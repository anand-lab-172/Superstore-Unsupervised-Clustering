# Superstore-Unsupervised/Clustering

This project contain data of customer details from Superstore they purchase.
I have did so many stages in this project which all include:

  * Data Preprocessing
  * EDA
  * Statistics
  * Future Engineering (Scaling/Normalizing the data)
  * Machine Learning (Unsupervised/Clustering)

Machine Learning algorithms used:

  * KMean Clustering
  * KMean Clustering using PCA
  * Hierarchical/Agglomerative
  * DBSCAN
 
Higlhlights:
  
  * Each stage are well explained
  * Got 99% accuracy in Unsupervised Learning
  
Kaggle competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/anandaramg/superstore-unsupervised-clustering-99-accuracy

Note: Getting 99% accuracy in unsupervised learning is rare and hence unsupervised learning doesn't contain label and proper output. So it's hard for the algorithm to predit the data, anything higher than 60% are considered as good accuracy in unsupervised/clustering.
